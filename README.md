# Ph.D. Proposal

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/citado/RoadToPhD/latex?label=latex&logo=github&style=flat-square)

- **Topic**: LoRa Network End-to-End Performance Evaluation
- **Start Date**: Fall 2022
- **Under Supervision**: Dr. Bakhshi, Dr. Rasti

## Introduction üëã

Ph.D. proposal/thesis on Age of Information in LoRa/LoRaWAN networks
by considering an optimization problem as a start point.
Here we want to see different parameters and their effect on age of information.
Some parameters tune a specific thing age of information but create bottleneck
in another layer.

My first topic is about end-to-end performance evaluation of LoRaWAN which
is failed by the internal committee of CEIT.

## How to write a proposal

These are the tips from Prof. Rasti:

- Do not use different words for the same concept
- Be specific about what you are doing, measuring, etc.
- Do not use etcetera
- Chapters can be read without any dependency
- Use specific citation in each line even for other sections or chapters
